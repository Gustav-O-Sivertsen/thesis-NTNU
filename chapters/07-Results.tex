\chapter{Results} \label{chap:Results}

%The results chapter should simply present the results of applying the methods presented in the method chapter without further ado. This chapter will typically contain many graphs, tables, etc. Sometimes it is natural to discuss the results as they are presented, combining them into a `Results and Discussion' chapter, but more often they are kept separate.\\ 

The following sections presents the results for each attack type, with subsections for the detection threshold levels selected, as defined in section \ref{sec:ExpDef} 
For each attack type defined, a number of attacks specifying various delay levels, specified as a number of samples, are covered.
For each delay level, a number of figures are produced by running the simulation.
A figure showing a combined view of all three components, displaying the delayed and original signals, as well as a signal indicating the actual difference between the two signals.  Three more detailed figures follows, comparing the original and delayed signal to a similarity measure for each of the three PMU output components.

The delay functions defined, delays the input signal by the specified number of samples, in one or more steps.

% delay.step    
% 1.1
% 2.1 2.2 
% 3.1 3.2 3.3
% 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4
% 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5

Comments on the results are included for selected figures, whereas, interpretation of the results are deferred to chapter \ref{chap:Discussions}
