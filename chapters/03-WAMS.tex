%\subsection{The Classic SCADA subsystem}

The \acrshort{scada} system constituted the core part of the control center of the classic \acrlong{pg}, utilising one-directional communication lines in order to manually control and monitor the operational state of the power grid.

Figure \ref{fig:Blume-SCADA-system} shows the main components of the SCADA system.

A centrally located control center, optionally being backed up by control centers at one or more locations for redundancy, displays status information from the equipment at the associated substations, received for monitoring purposes. As a response to alarms indicating operational issues, commands enabling remote control of affected infrastructure is issued in order to address the issue, in order to resolve the issue and receive updated status information clearing the alarm.

\subsection{Introduction}

Analogous with the modernisation of the classic \acrlong{pg} into the \acrlong{sg}, the \acrshort{scada} subsystem of the \acrshort{pg} is the predecessor of the control system of the modern \acrlong{sg}.
Therefore, a description of the \acrshort{scada} system, evolving from the centralised subsystem controlling the Classic \acrshort{pg}, to the modernised version of the \acrshort{scada} subsystem, initiates the description of the \acrlong{sg} Control System. 




The characteristics of the three generations of SCADA systems% described by \Citeauthor{alcaraz2012security} in \cite{alcaraz2012security},
may be summarised below:
 

 \begin{enumerate}
     \item A Monolithic SCADA system utilises a centralised offline control center  infrastructure, in order to monitor and control the physical system by proprietary control mechanisms.
     \item A Distributed SCADA system utilises a networked, but centralised control  center in order to monitor and control the physical system by proprietary control mechanisms. 
     \item A Networked SCADA system utilises a networked, and online control  center in order to monitor and control the physical system by standardised control mechanisms.
 \end{enumerate}







\subsection{The Modernised SCADA system}
 
 The \acrshort{scada} system is%, as described in \cite{alcaraz2012security},
 a system utilised to supervise and control \acrfull{ci} systems, including \acrshort{pg} infrastructures. Initially designed in order to control physical infrastructure systems like the classic \acrlong{pg}, the Monolithic SCADA system emerged into the Distributed SCADA system. The transition from a Monolithic SCADA system to a Distributed SCADA system transforms, as indicated by %figure \ref{fig:SCADA-CentralisedAndDistributed}
 , the central management center from a centrally controlled mainframe environment, to a networked server environment controlled by operators connected through a \acrfull{lan}
  
  
 The \acrshort{sg} control center emerged from the Distributed SCADA system, into the Networked SCADA system used in order to control modern \acrlong{cps}s, like the \acrshort{sg}.\\ 
 


 





 




However, as explained by \Citeauthor{zamani2020introduction} in \Cite{zamani2020introduction}, the \acrshort{scada} system has a number of shortcomings, making it unsuitable for a \acrshort{sg} enegy distribution monitoring system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The data polling rate is once every 2-10s, which is not sufficient in order to get real-time measurements.
    \item No time-stamps are attached to samples, making it hard to monitor rate of change over time
    \item State Estimation is not performed with sufficient frequency, if at all.
    \item The ability to observe dynamics is not supported by the system.
\end{itemize}





In order to address these shortcomings, the \acrfull{wams} system\footnote{WAMS is also known as the Wide Area \textbf{Monitoring} System}, described next, was invented.







The \acrshort{sg} consists of a vast number of both conventional and modern, more dynamic, production facilities, which requires thorough monitoring in order to ensure the optimal distribution of electrical energy. The requirement of a consistently stable and reliable supply of energy is constant, while the amount of energy demanded is dynamically changing according to the demand for power at any time. \\ 

Therefore, the proper \acrshort{sg} operation might be considered virtually impossible without a  close monitoring of current power flow, as well as the ability to instantly adjust the supply of power according to present needs,  without the risk of causing power surges or blackouts. For this purpose, the Wide Area Monitoring System analyses the levels of electrical power as monitored by sensors, synchronised according to a common GPS-controlled time source. \\ 

The correctness of this time source is critical to the reliability, and therefore, the proper operation of the monitoring system, constituting the primary decision criteria for actions controlling the supply of power.

%\subsection{WAMS Security} 

The \acrfull{sg} \acrfull{wams} is a \acrshort{sg} subsystem enabling \acrshort{sg} system operators to monitor the state of \acrshort{sg} energy flow, and general system state. 
A vital requirement for the view of the current state of the \acrshort{sg} energy distribution to be correct is, as described in previous chapters, the ability of the \acrshort{wams} Super \acrshort{pdc}  to utilise synchrophasors collected from the \acrshort{pdc}s to produce a view of the system state. In order for the view to be correct, however, the correctness of the timestamps i critical.  Therefore, in order to produce correct time stamps, the reliability of the Time Synchronisation source is of Critical importance.

\end{figure}










    

In order to ensure the continuous monitoring of the modern \acrlong{sg} energy distribution system, the \acrfull{wams} is utilised. An overview of the \acrshort{wams} architecture, as presented in   \cite{kumar2015monitoring}, is shown as \figureautorefname  { } \ref{fig:Kumar-WAMS-architecture}:

The \acrshort{wams} is, as described in  \cite{kumar2015monitoring}, a  system, consisting of:

(1) \acrshort{pmu}s, (2) \acrshort{pdc}s, (3) The super \acrshort{pdc}, and (4) Communication networks.

The various components might be described as follows, from (4) to (1):
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Communication Networks}, providing data transport between \acrshort{wams} components, as required.
    \item The \textbf{Super \acrshort{pdc}} controls several \acrshort{pdc}s constituting a distributed \acrshort{wams}.
\item The \textbf{\acrfull{pdc}} is responsible for collecting and interpreting \acrshort{pmu} measurements, before synchronising the measurements according to timestamps, in order to get more complete status information based on a combination of measurements.
    \item The \textbf{\acrfull{pmu}} is an intelligent measuring device, responsible for registering sensor measurements,  performing calculations like, for instance, phase angles, as well as voltage and current magnitudes. The data registered and processed by the \acrshort{pmu}, is transferred to the nearest \acrshort{pdc}.
    \end{itemize}
