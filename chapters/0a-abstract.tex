The traditional electrical power grid, responsible for the supply of electrical power to consumers of electric power, is in the process of being transformed to a network-controlled automated system for supplying electric power to consumers.
As a part of this transformation, the control and monitoring subsystems of the classic power grid is transformed from being a location-based closed system, to a Internet-connected Smart Grid. In addition, network-connected devices measuring and adjusting power consumption, are deployed to the locations of power consumers.
The transition described opens the possibility of the power supply infrastructure  being the victim of malicious Cyber attacks, with the potential intention to shut down  the electric power supply in the society, with the possible side-effect of destabilising the society itself.
