\chapter*{Abstract}

%The \texttt{ntnuthesis} document class is a customised version of the standard \LaTeX{} \texttt{report} document class. It can be used for theses at all levels – bachelor, master and PhD – and is available in English (British and American) and Norwegian (Bokmål and Nynorsk). This document is ment to serve (i) as a description of the document class, (ii) as an example of how to use it, and (iii) as a thesis template.


The traditional electrical power grid, responsible for the supply of electrical power to consumers of electric power, is in the process of being transformed to a network-controlled automated system for supplying electric power to consumers.
As a part of this transformation, the control and monitoring subsystems of the classic power grid is transformed from being a location-based closed system, to a Internet-connected Smart Grid. In addition, network-connected devices measuring and adjusting power consumption, are deployed to the locations of power consumers.
The transition described opens the possibility of the power distribution infrastructure being a victim of malicious Cyber attacks, with the potential intention to cause power grid blackouts, as well as severe damage to critical power grid infrastructure. The topic of my thesis, is to investigate potential effects of exposing phasor measurement units to time delay attacks, by exploiting known vulnerabilities in the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol, observing any consequences such exposure might have on Synchrophasor measurements, as well as attack detectability.
The results obtained indicates a relatively high possibility of getting away with attacks which cold be causing disturbances for grid operation.
