\section{Introduction}
In order to answer the research questions
\section{Summary}

\section{Considerations related to further work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item One option for further work could be to investigate the options of the Power Source object included in the PowerSource subsystem, possibly redesigning the PowerSource with a more realistic Smart Grid Transmission system.
\item Another option could be to replace the PMUs of the Dual PMU subsytem, with different PMU implementations.
\end{itemize}


Those options are independent, and could be combined.
