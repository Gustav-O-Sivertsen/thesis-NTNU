Two implementation strategies; proprietary and open source, are shaping the trends of the adoptability of SDN by major hardware manufacturers. A group of leading vendors believes that loose coupling between the logical and physical layers of a network hinders the proper provision of physical resources and suggests a proprietary fix to this problem. The other group regards the notion of openness as s key feature of SDN. This paper compares and contrasts these two implementation strategies of SDN by identifying their respective operating principles, features of the product lines, and weakness and strengths."

abstract="The smart grid that is a new concept introduced at the beginning of the 2000s intends to include bidirectional communication infrastructure to conventional grids in order to enable information and communication technologies (ICTs) at any stage of generation, transmission, distribution, and even consumption sections of utility grids. This chapter introduces essential components and novel technologies of smart grids such as sensor networks, smart metering and monitoring systems, smart management systems, wired and wireless communication technologies, security requirements, and standards and regulations for this concept. First of all, this chapter focuses on the main components of smart grids such as smart sensors and sensor networks, phasor measurement unit (PMU), smart meters (SMs), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Then, smart grid applications and main requirements are explained on the basis of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), demand response (DR), station and substation automation, and demand-side management (DSM). Later, communication systems of smart grid are presented in which the communication systems are classified into two groups as wired and wireless communication systems, and they are comprehensively analyzed. Furthermore, the area networks related to smart grid concept such as home area network (HAN), building area network (BAN), industrial area network (IAN), neighborhood area network (NAN), field area network (FAN), and wide-area network (WAN) are presented in a logical way beginning from generation systems to the user side.",

abstract="When we talk about smart grid we refer to the next generation of power systems that should and will replace existing power system grids through intelligent communication infrastructures, sensing technologies, advanced computing, smart meters, smart appliances, and renewable energy resources. Features of the smart grid must meet requirements as high efficiency, reliability, sustainability, flexibility, and market enabling. But, the growing dependency on information and communication technologies (ICTInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT)) with its applications and uses has led to new threats to discuss and to try to resist against them. On the one hand, the most important challenges for smart grid cyber security infrastructure are finding and designing optimum methods to secure communication networks between millions of inter-connected devices and entities throughout critical power facilities, especially by preventing attacks and defending against them with intelligent methods and systems in order to maintain our infrastructures resilient and without affecting their behavior and performances. On the other hand, another main challenge is to incorporate data security measures to the communication infrastructures and security protocols of the smart grid system keeping in mind the complexity of smart grid network and the specific cyber security threats and vulnerabilities. The basic concept of smart grid is to add control, monitoring, analysis, and the feature to communicate to the standard electrical system in order to reduce power consumption while achieving maximized throughput of the system. This technology, currently being developed around the world, will allow to use electricity as economically as possible for business and home user. The smart grid integrates various technical initiatives such as wide-area monitoring protection and control systems (WAMPACWide-Area Monitoring Protection and Control (WAMPAC)) based on phasor measurement unitsPhasor Measurement Units (PMU)(PMU), advanced metering infrastructure (AMIAdvanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)), demand response (DR), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and large-scale renewable integration in the form of wind and solar generation. Therefore, this chapter is focused on two main ideas considering modern smart grid infrastructures. The first idea is focused on high-level security requirements and objectives for the smart grid, and the second idea is about innovative concepts and methods to secure these critical infrastructures. The main challenge in assuring the security of such infrastructures is to obtain a high level of resiliency (immunity from various types of attacks) and to maintain the performances of the protected system. This chapter is organized in seven parts as follows. The first part of this chapter is an introduction in smart grid related to how it was developed in the last decades and what are the issues of smart grid in terms of cyber security. The second part shows the architecture of a smart grid network with all its features and utilities. The third part refers to the cyber security area of smart grid network which involves challenges, requirements, features, and objectives to secure the smart grid. The fourth part of this chapter is about attacks performed against smart grid network that happens because the threats and vulnerabilities existing in the smart grid system. The fifth part refers to the methods and countermeasures used to avoid or to minimize effects of complex attacks. The sixth part of the chapter is dedicated to presenting an innovative methodology for security assessment based on vulnerability scanning and honeypots usage. The last part concludes the chapter and draws some goals for future research directions. The main purposes of this chapter are: to present smart grid network architecture with all its issues, complexities, and features, to explore known and future threats and vulnerabilities of smart grid technology, to show how a highly secured smart grid should look like and how this next generation of power system should act and recover against the increasing complexity of cyber-attacks.",

  abstract  = {Smart grid uses the power of information technology to intelligently deliver energy by using a two-way communication and wisely meet the environmental requirements by facilitating the integration of green technologies. The inherent weakness of communication technology has exposed the system to numerous security threats. Several survey papers have discussed these problems and their countermeasures. However, most of these papers classified attacks based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but they excluded the accountability. In addition, the existing countermeasures focus on countering some specific attacks or protecting some specific components, but there is no global approach to secure the entire system. In this paper, we review the security requirements, provide descriptions of several severe cyber-attacks, and propose a cyber-security strategy to detect and counter these attacks. Lastly, we provide some future research directions.},

abstract = {<p>The operations of a smart grid heavily rely on the support of communication infrastructures for efficient electricity management and reliable power distribution. Due to the strong dependency, the robustness of a smart grid communication network against attack is of the utmost importance for the deployment of the smart grid. Notably, the large scale and autonomous features of a smart grid render its cyber security quite vulnerable to adversaries. In this article, we introduce several intelligent attacks and countermeasures in smart grid communication networks, which aim for maximal damage or benefits by taking advantage of the network structure as well as the protocol functionality. We adopt the percolation-based connectivity in statistic mechanics to quantitatively analyze the network robustness. If the attack and defense strategies are involved, the attack can be further smart and complicated. Consequently, a twoplayer zero-sum game is introduced between the adversary and the...},

In this paper, a novel Time Synchronization Attack (TSA) is proposed to attack the timing information in smart grid. Since many applications in smart grid utilize synchronous measurements and most of the measurement devices are equipped with global positioning system (GPS) for precise timing, it is highly probable to attack the measurement system by spoofing the GPS. The effectiveness of TSA is demonstrated for three applications of phasor measurement unit (PMU) in smart grid, namely transmission line fault detection, voltage stability monitoring and event locationing. The validity of TSA is demonstrated by numerical simulations.},
